#tupple is an imutable data structure which stores data in sequential manner just like a list 
#to create a tupple we use ournded brackests
# my_tuple = {1,2,3,4,"hello"}
# print(my_tuple)
# my_tuple[1] = 20

#creating tuple 
tuple_ds = ()
type(typle_ds)
print(tuple_ds)
tuple_ds = (1,2,3,4,5,'tuple_example')

#questions
