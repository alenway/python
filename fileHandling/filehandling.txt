File Handling:
a file is a named location used for storing data, python provides various functions to perform different file opperations this process is known as file handling

to open a file in python we use open function , we can open file in different modes, cread , write , append, etc bydefault python opens files in read mode

mode                    discription about mode
r                           opens file in read mode(default).
w                           opens file in write mode.
a                           opens a file in append mode(adds content at the end of file).
t                           opens a file in text mode.
b                           opens file in binary mode.
+                           open file in both read and write mode.

we can read the file using read function() and write in the file using write function()

if we open the file in write mode and the file does not exist then a new file is created.
after performing operation on the file, the file needs to be closed so we use close function() it is a good programing practice to close a fileas it freez up resources held by the file

we can also open a file using { with ---open } when we use this it automatically closes the file there for we dont need to use close function()

Method Name                         |                        Discription about the method
open()                              |               it use to open a file in various modes.
close()                             |               closes the open file.
read()                              |               reads the content of the file.
seek(offset, from)                  |        it is used to change the file position to offset bytes in reference to from. this is start, current , end.
tell()                              |               it returns an integer that represents the current position of the files object.
write(s)                            |               writes a string to the file.
writelines(lines)                   |               write a list of lines to the file
